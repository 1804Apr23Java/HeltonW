        <p>Horror movies are classically B-movies, with low budgets, terrible acting, and ridiculous scripts.  Many filmmakers get their starts with horror movies because they are an easy entry into the film industry.  Even though a lot of garbage is released, there is something to be said for sitting around laughing at a bad movie.  Even though they might not win any awards, some movies are great to put on, grab a beer, and laugh at the costumes and silly acting.  Here is a selection of our favorites.
